A Full Stack Website where we can keep track of the progress of all the projects that are being done.

Keeping track of progress means 
1) Keeping track of who is assigned to which project
2) Everyday updates on the progress and details of what one has done that day
3) Keeping a checklist of all the project deliverables and which ones are complete and which ones are pending.
4) This has to include an admin dashboard where admin can add new projects, and can approve or disapprove request of members to join that project
5) Host the website
